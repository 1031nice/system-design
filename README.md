# System Design Patterns

A curated collection of reusable architectural patterns and solutions for building scalable distributed systems.

## Purpose

This repository documents system design patterns discovered while studying distributed systems, databases, caching, messaging, and other architectural concepts. Each pattern represents a proven, repeatable solution that can be applied across different systems and technologies.

## Patterns

### Messaging & Queuing
- [Reliable Messaging Pattern](./reliable-messaging.md) - Guarantee message delivery using Redis RPOPLPUSH for at-least-once processing

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern document includes:
- **Problem**: The specific challenge the pattern addresses
- **Solution**: The core concept and approach
- **Implementation**: Concrete examples with code
- **Trade-offs**: Advantages and disadvantages
- **Use Cases**: Real-world applications
- **References**: Official documentation and further reading

## Contributing

This is a personal learning repository. Patterns are added as they are studied and understood in depth.
